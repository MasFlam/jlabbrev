# jlabbrev
The package `jlabbrev` adds all the  tab-completions from
the Julia prompt that are LaTeX symbol names.
There are currently **`2496`** abbreviations on the list.
Refer to the documentation page
[Unicode Input](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input)
of Julia if you want to get the full list. If all goes well,
all non-emoji completions from there should be supported by the plugin.

# Features
Writing `\<abbrev>` and hitting `<tab>` will do one of the following:
* If `<abbrev>` is one of the supported abbreviations,
  the whole sequence gets replaced with the corresponding symbol(s).
* If `<abbrev>` if a prefix of an abbreviation, autocompletion suggestion takes place
* Otherwise, the tab will be inserted

# Installation
As the plugin is in [the official plugin channel](https://github.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel),
you can install it by running `micro -plugin install jlabbrev` in your terminal.
